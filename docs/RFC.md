## Status
**Status**: Draft

## Summary

This RFC proposes a scalable and secure legal case management system using a microservices architecture built on a robust technology stack.  The system will prioritize security, performance, and maintainability, ensuring compliance with legal and data privacy regulations.  A phased implementation approach will deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly, followed by iterative enhancements based on user feedback and evolving business needs.

## Background and Motivation

The current lack of a centralized, efficient case management system results in duplicated efforts, missed deadlines, and difficulties in maintaining client communication and document organization. This leads to decreased efficiency, increased risk of errors, and potential legal liabilities.  This project aims to address these issues by providing a comprehensive platform that streamlines legal workflows and enhances client service.


## Detailed Design

### System Architecture

We propose a microservices architecture to enhance scalability, maintainability, and resilience.  Key microservices will include:

* **Case Management Service:** Core case tracking, deadlines, and document management.
* **Client Portal Service:** Secure client access to documents and communication.
* **Communication Service:** Secure messaging and communication logging.
* **Billing & Time Tracking Service:** Integration with existing billing systems or a new time tracking and billing module.
* **User Authentication & Authorization Service:** Centralized authentication and role-based access control.
* **Document Management Service:** Secure storage and version control of legal documents.


These services will communicate via a lightweight message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous communication and decoupling.  A centralized API gateway will manage routing and security.

**Data Flow:**  Data flows between services as needed. For example, the Case Management Service will interact with the Document Management Service to store and retrieve case documents.  The Client Portal Service will access data from the Case Management Service to display case information to clients.

**Integration Points:**  The system will integrate with existing billing systems via APIs (if feasible and cost-effective) or include a custom time tracking and billing module.  Consideration will be given to API integrations with court systems (where available and permitted).

### Technology Choices

* **Backend Framework:**  FastAPI (Python) - Offers high performance and ease of development.
* **Frontend Framework:** React with TypeScript - Provides a robust and maintainable user interface.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL -  Offers scalability, ACID properties, and robust features for handling complex data relationships.  SQLite will be used for initial development and testing.
* **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ -  Proven reliable and scalable message broker.
* **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 with JWT - Industry standard for secure authentication and authorization.
* **Deployment:** Kubernetes on a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure) - Enables scalability and high availability.
* **Search:** Elasticsearch - For efficient full-text search across documents and case details.


### API Design

RESTful API principles will be followed, with clear, consistent endpoint naming conventions (e.g., `/cases/{case_id}/documents`).  JSON will be used for request and response formats.  Detailed API documentation will be generated using OpenAPI.

### Database Schema

A detailed database schema will be developed, encompassing entities like Cases, Clients, Documents, Users, Tasks, and Events.  Relationships between entities will be carefully defined, and appropriate indexes will be implemented to optimize query performance.  Data migration strategies will be defined to manage schema changes over time.

### Security Considerations

* **Authentication & Authorization:** OAuth 2.0 with JWT, role-based access control, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
* **Data Encryption:** End-to-end encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit.  Compliance with relevant legal and data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
* **Input Validation & Sanitization:**  Strict input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
* **Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention:** Implementation of rate limiting and other security measures to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

### Performance Requirements

The system must handle a significant number of concurrent users and transactions.  Response times should be under 200ms for most operations.  Scalability will be achieved through the microservices architecture, horizontal scaling, and caching strategies (e.g., Redis).

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: MVP (6-8 weeks)

* Core case management functionality (creation, updates, basic search).
* Basic client portal with document viewing.
* Secure user authentication and authorization.
* Simple task assignment and workflow.
* Basic reporting.

### Phase 2: Enhancement (8-12 weeks)

* Advanced features (court date scheduling, conflict checking, expense tracking, invoicing).
* Improved user interface and user experience (UX).
* Enhanced security features (MFA, audit logging).
* Integration with existing billing systems (if feasible).


### Phase 3: Production Readiness (4-6 weeks)

* Comprehensive testing and QA.
* Deployment automation using CI/CD pipelines.
* Monitoring and logging infrastructure.
* Documentation and training materials.
* Performance and load testing.


## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy encompassing unit, integration, end-to-end, and performance testing will be implemented.  Automated testing will be heavily emphasized.

## Deployment and Operations

The system will be deployed using Kubernetes on a cloud platform.  A robust CI/CD pipeline will be implemented to automate deployments and ensure rapid release cycles.  Comprehensive monitoring and alerting will be in place to ensure system uptime and performance.

## Alternative Approaches Considered

Monolithic architecture was considered but rejected due to its lower scalability and maintainability compared to a microservices approach.  Other database options (e.g., MongoDB) were evaluated, but PostgreSQL was chosen for its ACID properties and suitability for relational data.

## Risks and Mitigation

* **Technical Risk:** Integration challenges with existing systems.  **Mitigation:** Thorough API testing and development of robust integration adapters.
* **Security Risk:** Data breaches.  **Mitigation:**  Implementation of strong security measures, regular security audits, and penetration testing.
* **Business Risk:**  User adoption.  **Mitigation:**  User training, feedback mechanisms, and iterative improvements based on user feedback.

## Success Metrics

* User adoption rate.
* System uptime and performance.
* Reduction in manual effort.
* Improved client satisfaction.


## Timeline and Milestones

(Detailed timeline with specific milestones and deliverables will be provided in a separate project plan.)

## Open Questions

* Specific integration details with existing billing systems.
* Final selection of cloud provider.
