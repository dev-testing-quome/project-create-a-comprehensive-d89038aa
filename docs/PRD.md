    * Customizable reports on case status, billing, time tracking, and expenses.
    * Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) dashboard.


**4. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **Performance:**  The application should respond within 2 seconds for most actions.  Load testing will be conducted to ensure scalability.
* **Security:**  Data encryption at rest and in transit (HTTPS, TLS 1.3 minimum).  Compliance with relevant legal and data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).  Regular security audits and penetration testing.  Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
* **Scalability:** The application should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and cases.  Horizontal scaling should be implemented.
* **Usability:**  Intuitive and user-friendly interface.  Comprehensive user documentation and training materials.  Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA).


**5. Technical Requirements:**

* **Technology Stack:**
    * Backend: FastAPI (Python)
    * Frontend: React.js
    * Database: PostgreSQL (with consideration for scalability and data integrity)
    * Cloud Provider: AWS (or similar - to be determined)
* **API Specifications:**  RESTful API using OpenAPI/Swagger specification.  Detailed API documentation will be provided.
* **Database Schema:**  A detailed ER diagram will be created and reviewed before development begins.  Data normalization and efficient indexing are crucial.
* **Third-Party Integrations:**  APIs for billing software (to be specified), OCR services (e.g., Google Cloud Vision API), and potentially email and calendar services (e.g., Google Calendar API).


**6. Acceptance Criteria:**

* Each feature will have specific acceptance criteria defined in user stories and test cases.
* Success metrics will include user adoption rate, task completion rate, and client satisfaction scores.
* User acceptance testing (UAT) will be conducted with a representative group of attorneys and legal staff.


**7. Release Criteria:**

* **MVP:**  Case management, client portal with basic document sharing, calendar with deadline reminders, and secure messaging.
* **Launch Readiness Checklist:**  Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, system, UAT), security audit, performance testing, documentation completion, deployment plan, and rollback strategy.
* **Post-Launch Monitoring:**  Monitoring system performance, user feedback, bug reports, and security alerts.  Regular updates and feature enhancements based on user feedback and data analysis.


**8. Assumptions and Dependencies:**

* **Technical Assumptions:**  Availability of reliable cloud infrastructure and third-party APIs.  Sufficient expertise in FastAPI, React, and PostgreSQL.
* **Business Assumptions:**  Sufficient funding for development and ongoing maintenance.  Market demand for a comprehensive legal case management system.
* **External Dependencies:**  Successful integration with third-party billing software and OCR services.


**9. Risks and Mitigation:**

* **Technical Risks:**  Integration challenges with third-party APIs.  Performance bottlenecks.  Security vulnerabilities.
    * **Mitigation:**  Thorough API testing, performance testing, security audits, and penetration testing.  Robust error handling and logging.
* **Business Risks:**  Market competition.  Lack of user adoption.  Insufficient funding.
    * **Mitigation:**  Competitive analysis, marketing and sales strategy, phased rollout, and securing sufficient funding.


**10. Next Steps:**

* **Development Phases:**  Requirements gathering (completed), design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Agile methodology will be used.
* **Timeline Considerations:**  Detailed project timeline will be created based on sprint planning.
* **Resource Requirements:**  Dedicated development team (frontend, backend, database), project manager, QA testers.


**11. Conclusion:**
