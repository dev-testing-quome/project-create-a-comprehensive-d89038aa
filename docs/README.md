* **Encrypted Data Storage:**  Ensures compliance with legal professional standards and maintains attorney-client privilege.


**Technical Highlights:**

* **RESTful API:**  Clean and well-documented API for easy integration with other systems.
* **Automated Testing:**  Comprehensive unit and integration tests ensure code quality and reliability.
* **Scalable Architecture:**  Designed for scalability to handle increasing numbers of cases and users.


## Technology Stack

* **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
* **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
* **Database**: SQLite (with SQLAlchemy ORM - easily swappable for PostgreSQL, MySQL etc. for production)
* **Containerization**: Docker
* **Security:**  HTTPS, input validation, and robust authentication mechanisms.


## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Node.js 18 or higher (and npm)
* Docker (optional, but recommended for deployment)
* A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)


## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Application:**

   * **Backend:** (from the `backend` directory)
     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```

   * **Frontend:** (from the `frontend` directory)
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

### Docker Setup

1.  Navigate to the project root directory.
2.  Run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.
